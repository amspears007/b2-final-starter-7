1. Merchant Coupons Index 

As a merchant
When I visit my merchant dashboard page
I see a link to view all of my coupons
When I click this link
I'm taken to my coupons index page
Where I see all of my coupon names including their amount off 
And each coupon's name is also a link to its show page.

2. Merchant Coupon Create 

As a merchant
When I visit my coupon index page 
I see a link to create a new coupon.
When I click that link 
I am taken to a new page where I see a form to add a new coupon.
When I fill in that form with a name, unique code, an amount, and whether that amount is a percent or a dollar amount
And click the Submit button
I'm taken back to the coupon index page 
And I can see my new coupon listed.
* Sad Paths to consider: 
1. This Merchant already has 5 active coupons
2. Coupon code entered is NOT unique

3. Merchant Coupon Show Page 

As a merchant 
When I visit a merchant's coupon show page 
I see that coupon's name and code 
And I see the percent/dollar off value
As well as its status (active or inactive)
And I see a count of how many times that coupon has been used.

(Note: "use" of a coupon should be limited to successful transactions.)
